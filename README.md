# Simon Game

This project is a web-based version of the classic Simon memory game. The player is required to repeat a sequence of button presses generated by the computer, with the sequence getting longer as the game progresses. The game continues until the player presses the wrong button.

## Features
- Simple interface styled using CSS
- Game sounds for user feedback
- Key press detection to start the game
- Displays current level on each successful sequence
- Changes background and shows game over text on incorrect input
- Uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and game logic
- Classic 4-color button layout

### Prerequisites
To run the project locally, you need:
- A modern web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- Optionally, you can use a web server for local development, like Live Server.
